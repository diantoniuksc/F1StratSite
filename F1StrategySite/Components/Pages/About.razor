              <p><strong>Hello 👋 and thank you for visiting my website!</strong></p>

              <p>
                I truly enjoyed creating this project and I hope you’ve enjoyed exploring it
                as much as I enjoyed building it. The idea of making a website like this came
                to me long before I even started coding it, which is why it feels so special to me now.
              </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">
                My name is <strong>Diana (Di for friends)</strong>, and I’m from Ukraine.
                I’ve been working with <i>C#</i> for over 4 years, and I’ve realized that
                building digital experiences like this is something I deeply enjoy. I like to
                think of myself as an artist — my laptop is the brush, and this website is my masterpiece.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-3">
                When you first arrive, you’re welcomed by the <i>Home Page</i>, where you can
                navigate to the <i>Strategy Prediction</i> tool for custom stints. Next, you
                can visit the <i>Next Grand Prix Page</i>, which features useful information
                about the upcoming race — from circuit details to Grand Prix insights,
                beautifully decorated with images provided by the <i>Pexels API</i>, and
                weather data powered by the <i>api.open-meteo.com</i>.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-3">
                But the highlight is the <strong><i>Race Strategy Page</i></strong> — my favorite
                part of the site. Here you can choose any Grand Prix, click <strong>View Analysis</strong>,
                and dive into a detailed <i>Race Strategy Analysis</i>. You’ll find visualizations
                of plausible driver stints, a tire compound key, and last year’s race statistics.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-3">
                And now, you’re here — reading this message. <strong>Thank you for being part
                of the journey 💙💛</strong>
              </p>

              <p class="mb-3">
                But this isn’t just about me — it’s about building a community. If you have
                cool ideas, improvements, suggestions, or want to collaborate, I’d love to hear from you!
